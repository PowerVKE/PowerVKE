PowerVKE works closely with VMware PowerCLI, and PowerCLI users will feel quickly at home using PowerVKE. Together these tools provide a comprehensive command line environment for managing your VMware VKE for vSphere environments.
PowerVKE is still a work in progress, and it is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the VKE API.
