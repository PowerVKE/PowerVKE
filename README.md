# PowerVKE

PowerVKE is a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware Kubernetes Engine API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions. 

This is a community developed module and is not supported by VMware. It comes with no warranties express or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using this product in a production environment.

PowerVKE was initially developed by a team at the VMworld Europe 2018 Hackathon. PowerVKE is very much work in progress, and it is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the VKE API.
